# Basics

This section introduces you to the basic building blocks of Nebula
using `nebulakit`. `nebulakit` is a Python SDK for developing Nebula workflows and
tasks, and can be used generally, whenever stateful computation is desirable.
`nebulakit` workflows and tasks are completely runnable locally, unless they need
some advanced backend functionality like starting a distributed Spark cluster.

Here, you will learn how to write Nebula tasks, assemble them into workflows,
run bash scripts, and document workflows.
